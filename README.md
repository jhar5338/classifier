# Classifier
A Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours classifier used on Indian diabetes data.

## Description
Using args in the form of (file) (file) (classifier) this program prints the results of a classifier predicting class yes or no.

First arg will be training data file, second arg will be testing data file, third arg will be NB for naive bayes, or KNN where K is a digit from 1 to 5. 3rd arg is case sensitive.
